### Instructions for Cleaning Vamos Ler! Data


This document captures the data cleaning process for the Vamos Ler Data. The purpose of the code is to demonstrate the process by which the data are transformed into a tidy dataset. The .R file to reproduce the analysis is captured in the ```00_Clean_VamosLer.R``` file.

After reading the data into the global environment, we can check the structure of the Excel table using the ```head``` function:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
head(df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
